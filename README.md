### AWS Cloud Deployment

The application has been successfully deployed to **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** using a modern containerized architecture with managed services. This production deployment demonstrates enterprise-grade cloud infrastructure skills and DevOps practices.

**Live Production API**: [http://project.jcarl.net:8080/api](http://project.jcarl.net:8080/api)  
**Custom Domain**: `project.jcarl.net` (via Namesilo DNS with API-based auto-update)

#### AWS Architecture

The deployment leverages multiple AWS services in a scalable, secure architecture:

- **AWS RDS MySQL**: Managed database service for production data
  - Endpoint: `music-library-db.cv4kawuomqo5.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com:3306`
  - Automated backups, monitoring, and maintenance
  - Security group configured for ECS access only

- **AWS ECR**: Private Docker container registry
  - Repository: `913212790762.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/music-library`
  - Secure image storage and versioning

- **AWS ECS Fargate**: Serverless container orchestration
  - Cluster: `music-library-cluster1`
  - Service: `music-library-service`
  - No server management required
  - Auto-scaling capabilities
  - Dynamic IP address management

- **Namesilo DNS**: Third-party DNS management with API-based automation
  - Domain: `jcarl.net` managed through Namesilo
  - A Record: `project.jcarl.net` → ECS Fargate public IP
  - Automated DNS updates via Namesilo API at container startup
  - Record ID: `<record-id>`
  - TTL: 7207 seconds

- **AWS CodeBuild**: Automated CI/CD pipeline
  - Builds Docker images from source
  - Pushes to ECR automatically
  - Configured via `buildspec.yml`

- **AWS S3**: Build artifact storage
- **AWS IAM**: Role-based access control and security
  - Task execution role for ECS container management
  - Secure environment variable management

#### Solving the Dynamic IP Challenge

**Problem**: AWS ECS Fargate assigns dynamic public IP addresses that change whenever tasks restart, making it difficult to maintain a consistent API endpoint for users and documentation.

**Solution**: Implemented a container-based automated DNS management system that updates Namesilo DNS at startup:

1. **Container Scripts**: Created `/update-namesilo-dns.sh` and `/startup.sh` scripts embedded in the Docker image
2. **IP Detection**: Uses ECS Task Metadata Endpoint V4 (`$ECS_CONTAINER_METADATA_URI_V4/task`) to retrieve the Fargate task's public IP
3. **DNS Update**: Namesilo API call updates the A record for `project.jcarl.net`
4. **Startup Integration**: Docker ENTRYPOINT runs `startup.sh` which calls the Namesilo DNS update script before starting the application
5. **API Authentication**: Uses Namesilo API key stored as ECS environment variable
6. **Required Tools**: Container includes `curl` and `jq` (installed in Alpine Linux base image)
7. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation - application starts even if DNS update fails

**Technical Implementation**:
```bash
# Container detects its own IP and updates Namesilo DNS
TASK_METADATA=$(curl -s $ECS_CONTAINER_METADATA_URI_V4/task)
PUBLIC_IP=$(echo $TASK_METADATA | jq -r '.Containers[0].Networks[0].IPv4Addresses[0]')

# Update Namesilo DNS record via API
curl "https://www.namesilo.com/api/dnsUpdateRecord?version=1&type=xml&key=${NAMESILO_API_KEY}&domain=jcarl.net&rrid=<record-id>&rrhost=project&rrvalue=${PUBLIC_IP}&rrttl=7207"
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Consistent API endpoint regardless of infrastructure changes
- ✅ Self-contained solution - no external Lambda functions required
- ✅ Updates DNS within seconds of container startup
- ✅ Fully automated - no manual intervention required
- ✅ Professional custom domain instead of raw IP addresses
- ✅ No AWS IAM permissions required for DNS updates
- ✅ Works with third-party DNS providers

This solution showcases real-world DevOps problem-solving: identifying infrastructure limitations and implementing automated solutions using container-native approaches and third-party API integration.

#### Docker Containerization

The application uses a **multi-stage Docker build** for optimal image size and security. Two Dockerfile versions are maintained:

**Current Version (Namesilo DNS)**:
```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build with Maven
FROM maven:3.9-eclipse-temurin-17 AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY pom.xml .
COPY src ./src
RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests

# Stage 2: Runtime with OpenJDK + Namesilo DNS automation
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jre-alpine
WORKDIR /app

# Install curl and jq for DNS updates
RUN apk add --no-cache curl jq

# Copy DNS update scripts
COPY update-namesilo-dns.sh /update-namesilo-dns.sh
COPY startup.sh /startup.sh
RUN chmod +x /update-namesilo-dns.sh /startup.sh

COPY --from=build /app/target/*.jar app.jar
EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT ["/startup.sh"]
```

**Previous Version (Route 53 DNS)**: Available in git history, used AWS CLI for Route 53 DNS updates

**Benefits**:
- Smaller final image (only JRE, not full JDK)
- Build dependencies not included in runtime
- Faster deployments and reduced attack surface
- Automated DNS management at container startup
- Shell compatibility with Alpine Linux (ash shell)

#### Deployment Validation

The AWS deployment was thoroughly tested using Postman:
- **182 API requests** executed successfully
- **600 tests** passed (100% pass rate)
- All CRUD operations validated
- Relationship queries verified
- Performance metrics collected

This comprehensive testing ensures production readiness and API reliability.

### Package Structure

The application follows a standard layered architecture:

- **`music.library`** - Root package
  - **`controller`** - REST API endpoints (presentation layer)
  - **`service`** - Business logic (service layer)
  - **`repository`** - Data access (persistence layer)
  - **`entity`** - JPA entities (domain model)
  - **`dto`** - Data Transfer Objects (API contracts)
  - **`exception`** - Custom exceptions and error handling
  - **`config`** - Spring configuration classes
  - **`specification`** - JPA Specifications for dynamic queries

---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Application Configuration (application.yaml)

The application uses YAML configuration with environment variables for flexibility:

```yaml
# Server Configuration
server:
  port: ${PORT:8080}  # Server port, fallback to 8080 if not specified

# Database Configuration
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://${MYSQL_HOST}:${MYSQL_PORT}/${MYSQL_DATABASE}?useSSL=false
    driver-class-name: com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
    username: ${MYSQL_USER}
    password: ${MYSQL_PASSWORD}

  # JPA / Hibernate Configuration
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: update              # Hibernate manages schema updates
    show-sql: true                  # Print SQL statements (debug)

  # Springdoc / Swagger UI Configuration
  springdoc:
    api-docs:
      path: /v3/api-docs
    swagger-ui:
      enabled: true
      path: /swagger-ui.html

# Prevent Spring from executing plain .sql scripts
sql:
  init:
    mode: never
```

### Environment Variables

Required environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `MYSQL_HOST` | MySQL server hostname | `localhost` |
| `MYSQL_PORT` | MySQL server port | `3306` |
| `MYSQL_DATABASE` | Database name | `music_library` |
| `MYSQL_USER` | Database username | `music_user` |
| `MYSQL_PASSWORD` | Database password | `your_secure_password` |
| `PORT` | Server port (optional) | `8080` |

### Test Configuration (application-test.yaml)

Tests use an H2 in-memory database for fast, isolated testing:

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
    driver-class-name: org.h2.Driver
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: create-drop
```

---

## 🔍 Testing

The application includes a comprehensive test suite covering multiple layers.

### Test Structure

```
src/test/java/music/library/
├── integration/              # Full stack integration tests
│   ├── ArtistControllerIT.java
│   ├── AlbumControllerIT.java
│   ├── AlbumControllerUpdateDeleteIT.java
│   └── GenreControllerIT.java
├── service/                  # Service layer unit tests
│   ├── ArtistServiceTest.java
│   ├── AlbumServiceTest.java
│   └── AlbumServiceBidirectionalTest.java
└── repository/               # Repository layer tests
    └── AlbumRepositoryTest.java
```

### Test Types

#### 1. Integration Tests (`*IT.java`)

Full-stack tests using `@SpringBootTest` and `MockMvc`:

- Test complete request/response cycle
- Use H2 in-memory database
- Verify HTTP status codes, headers, and response bodies
- Test pagination, sorting, and filtering
- Validate error handling and edge cases

**Example:**
```java
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureMockMvc
@TestInstance(TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_CLASS)
class ArtistControllerIT {
    @Autowired
    private MockMvc mockMvc;
    
    @Test
    void testCreateArtist() throws Exception {
        mockMvc.perform(post("/api/artists")
            .contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
            .content("{\"name\":\"The Beatles\"}"))
            .andExpect(status().isCreated())
            .andExpect(jsonPath("$.name").value("The Beatles"));
    }
}
```

#### 2. Service Tests (`*Test.java`)

Unit tests for business logic using Mockito:

- Mock repository dependencies
- Test service methods in isolation
- Verify exception handling
- Test bidirectional relationship management

**Example:**
```java
@ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
class ArtistServiceTest {
    @Mock
    private ArtistRepository artistRepository;
    
    @InjectMocks
    private ArtistService artistService;
    
    @Test
    void testFindById_Success() {
        Artist artist = new Artist();
        artist.setArtistId(1L);
        when(artistRepository.findById(1L)).thenReturn(Optional.of(artist));
        
        Artist result = artistService.findById(1L);
        
        assertNotNull(result);
        assertEquals(1L, result.getArtistId());
    }
}
```

#### 3. Repository Tests

Tests for custom repository queries and JPA behavior:

- Test custom query methods
- Verify relationship mappings
- Test cascade operations

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
mvn test

# Run specific test class
mvn test -Dtest=ArtistControllerIT

# Run tests
mvn test

# View test results
# Individual test results are in target/surefire-reports/
```

### Test Results

Test execution results are generated by **Maven Surefire**:

- Test reports generated in `target/surefire-reports/`
- XML and text reports for each test class
- Console output shows test pass/fail summary

### Test Configuration

Tests use a separate profile (`test`) with H2 database:

```yaml
# application-test.yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:h2:mem:testdb
    driver-class-name: org.h2.Driver
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: create-drop
  flyway:
    enabled: false
```

The Maven Surefire plugin automatically activates the test profile:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
    <configuration>
        <systemPropertyVariables>
            <spring.profiles.active>test</spring.profiles.active>
        </systemPropertyVariables>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```

### Test Best Practices

✅ Use `@TestInstance(PER_CLASS)` for efficient test data reuse  
✅ Clean up test data in `@AfterEach` or `@AfterAll` methods  
✅ Use meaningful test names (e.g., `testCreateArtist_WithValidData_ReturnsCreated`)  
✅ Test both success and failure scenarios  
✅ Verify exception messages and error responses  
✅ Use `@Transactional` for tests that modify data  

---

  --memory 512 \
  --container-definitions '[
    {
      "name": "music-library",
      "image": "913212790762.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/music-library:latest",
      "portMappings": [{"containerPort": 80, "protocol": "tcp"}],
      "environment": [
        {"name": "MYSQL_HOST", "value": "music-library-db.cv4kawuomqo5.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com"},
        {"name": "MYSQL_PORT", "value": "3306"},
        {"name": "MYSQL_DATABASE", "value": "music_library"},
        {"name": "MYSQL_USER", "value": "admin"},
        {"name": "MYSQL_PASSWORD", "value": "<password>"}
      ]
    }
  ]'
```

##### 5. ECS Service Creation

```bash
# Create ECS service
aws ecs create-service \
  --cluster music-library-cluster1 \
  --service-name music-library-service \
  --task-definition music-library-task \
  --desired-count 1 \
  --launch-type FARGATE \
  --network-configuration "awsvpcConfiguration={
    subnets=[<subnet-id>],
    securityGroups=[<security-group-id>],
    assignPublicIp=ENABLED
  }"
```

**ECS Service**: `music-library-service` in cluster `music-library-cluster1`

#### Security Configuration

##### ECS Security Group

```bash
# Allow HTTP traffic on port 80
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
  --group-id <ecs-security-group-id> \
  --protocol tcp \
  --port 80 \
  --cidr 0.0.0.0/0

# Allow outbound to RDS
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-egress \
  --group-id <ecs-security-group-id> \
  --protocol tcp \
  --port 3306 \
  --destination-group <rds-security-group-id>
```

##### RDS Security Group

```bash
# Allow inbound from ECS only
aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \
  --group-id <rds-security-group-id> \
  --protocol tcp \
  --port 3306 \
  --source-group <ecs-security-group-id>
```

#### Environment Variables

The application is configured via environment variables in the ECS task definition:

```yaml
environment:
  - MYSQL_HOST=music-library-db.cv4kawuomqo5.us-west-2.rds.amazonaws.com
  - MYSQL_PORT=3306
  - MYSQL_DATABASE=music_library
  - MYSQL_USER=admin
  - MYSQL_PASSWORD=<secure-password>
  - PORT=80
```

These variables are referenced in `application.yaml`:

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://${MYSQL_HOST}:${MYSQL_PORT}/${MYSQL_DATABASE}?useSSL=false
    username: ${MYSQL_USER}
    password: ${MYSQL_PASSWORD}
server:
  port: ${PORT:80}
```

#### Docker Multi-Stage Build

The `Dockerfile` uses a multi-stage build for optimization:

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build application with Maven
FROM maven:3.9-eclipse-temurin-17 AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY pom.xml .
COPY src ./src
RUN mvn clean package -DskipTests

# Stage 2: Create runtime image
FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jre-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app/target/*.jar app.jar
EXPOSE 80
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```

**Benefits**:
- **Smaller image size**: Only JRE in final image (~150MB vs ~600MB)
- **Faster deployments**: Less data to transfer
- **Better security**: Build tools not in production image
- **Layer caching**: Maven dependencies cached separately

#### Deployment Validation

The AWS deployment was validated using comprehensive Postman testing:

- ✅ **182 API requests** executed successfully
- ✅ **600 tests** passed (100% pass rate)
- ✅ **19.2 seconds** total execution time
- ✅ All CRUD operations verified
- ✅ Relationship queries validated
- ✅ Error handling confirmed
- ✅ Pagination and sorting tested

#### AWS Deployment Benefits

- **Scalability**: ECS Fargate auto-scales based on demand
- **Reliability**: Managed services with built-in redundancy
- **Security**: VPC isolation, security groups, IAM roles
- **Maintenance**: Automated backups, patching, monitoring
- **Cost-effective**: Pay only for resources used
- **CI/CD**: Automated builds and deployments with CodeBuild

## Deployment Journey & Learning Experiences

This section documents the real-world challenges, solutions, and learning experiences encountered during the AWS deployment process. It demonstrates problem-solving skills, adaptability, and persistence in overcoming infrastructure obstacles.

### Overview

The deployment journey involved multiple iterations, technology pivots, and creative problem-solving to achieve a fully automated, production-ready deployment. The final solution uses **ECS Fargate task revision 7** with **Namesilo DNS API** for automated domain management.

**Current Deployment Status**:
- **Domain**: `project.jcarl.net`
- **IP Address**: Dynamic, assigned on each deploy
- **Port**: `8080`
- **ECS Task**: `music-library-task:x`
- **DNS Provider**: Namesilo (migrated from Route 53)
- **Build Environment**: AWS CloudShell (due to Windows LTSB Docker incompatibility)

---

### Challenge 1: Route 53 DNS Automation Attempts

**Initial Approach**: Automate DNS updates using AWS Route 53 with container startup scripts.

**Problems Encountered**:

1. **Bash Heredoc Syntax Errors in Alpine Linux**
   - **Issue**: Alpine Linux uses `ash` shell, not `bash`
   - **Symptom**: Heredoc syntax in Route 53 update scripts failed with parsing errors
   - **Root Cause**: Bash-specific features not available in ash shell
   - **Attempted Solutions**:
     - Tried installing bash in Alpine container
     - Attempted to rewrite scripts for ash compatibility
     - Explored alternative JSON formatting approaches
   - **Outcome**: Syntax complexity made Route 53 automation unreliable in Alpine

2. **JSON Formatting Challenges**
   - **Issue**: Route 53 API requires complex nested JSON structures
   - **Symptom**: JSON escaping errors in shell scripts
   - **Attempted Solutions**:
     - Used jq for JSON construction
     - Tried heredoc with proper escaping
     - Attempted external JSON template files
   - **Outcome**: Overly complex for container startup automation

**Learning**: Shell compatibility matters when choosing base images. Alpine's ash shell has limitations compared to bash.

---

### Challenge 2: IAM Permission Issues

**Problem**: ECS tasks failed to register new task definitions due to insufficient IAM permissions.

**Error Message**:
```
AccessDeniedException: User: arn:aws:sts::913212790762:assumed-role/ecsTaskExecutionRole/...
is not authorized to perform: ecs:RegisterTaskDefinition
```

**Investigation**:
- Task execution role had permissions for ECR, CloudWatch, but not ECS task registration
- Needed to distinguish between task execution role and task role
- Route 53 permissions were added to task role, but ECS permissions were missing

**Attempted Solutions**:
1. Added `ecs:RegisterTaskDefinition` to task execution role
2. Created separate task role with Route 53 permissions
3. Verified IAM policy attachments in AWS Console

**Outcome**: Permissions resolved, but led to next challenge with ECS circuit breaker.

**Learning**: AWS IAM has distinct roles for task execution (infrastructure) vs. task role (application). Understanding this distinction is critical for ECS deployments.

---

### Challenge 3: ECS Circuit Breaker and Task Rollbacks

**Problem**: ECS service repeatedly rolled back from new task revisions (4, 5, 6) to revision 2.

**Symptoms**:
- Tasks would start (PROVISIONING → PENDING → RUNNING)
- Health checks would fail
- Circuit breaker triggered automatic rollback
- Service reverted to last known good revision (revision 2)

**Error Pattern**:
```
Task revision 4: RUNNING → STOPPED (Circuit breaker threshold exceeded)
Task revision 5: RUNNING → STOPPED (Circuit breaker threshold exceeded)
Task revision 6: RUNNING → STOPPED (Circuit breaker threshold exceeded)
Rolled back to: Task revision 2
```

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. **DNS Update Script Failures**: Route 53 scripts failing silently, causing container startup delays
2. **Health Check Timeouts**: Application took too long to start due to DNS script execution
3. **Shell Compatibility**: Ash vs. bash issues causing script failures
4. **Missing Dependencies**: AWS CLI installation issues in Alpine Linux

**Attempted Solutions**:
1. Increased health check grace period
2. Modified startup scripts to continue even if DNS update fails
3. Simplified Route 53 update logic
4. Added verbose logging to diagnose failures
5. Tested scripts locally in Alpine container

**Outcome**: Circuit breaker continued to trigger. Decision made to pivot away from Route 53.

**Learning**: ECS circuit breaker is aggressive but protective. When tasks repeatedly fail health checks, it's better to pivot to a simpler solution than fight the system.

---

### Challenge 4: Windows LTSB Docker Incompatibility

**Problem**: Local Windows LTSB (Long-Term Servicing Branch) system incompatible with Docker Desktop.

**Symptoms**:
- Docker Desktop installation failed
- Hyper-V requirements not met on LTSB
- Unable to build Docker images locally for testing

**Impact**:
- Couldn't test Dockerfile changes locally
- Had to rely on ECS deployments for testing (slow feedback loop)
- Difficult to debug container startup issues

**Solution**: **AWS CloudShell**
- Cloud-based Linux environment with Docker pre-installed
- Direct access to AWS services (ECR, ECS)
- No local Docker installation required
- Commands used:
  ```bash
  # Build in CloudShell
  docker build -t music-library .
  
  # Tag for ECR
  docker tag music-library:latest 913212790762.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/music-library:latest
  
  # Push to ECR
  docker push 913212790762.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/music-library:latest
  ```

**Outcome**: CloudShell became the primary build environment, enabling rapid iteration.

**Learning**: Cloud-based development environments can overcome local system limitations. AWS CloudShell is a powerful tool for AWS-centric workflows.

---

### Challenge 5: Migration to Namesilo DNS

**Decision Point**: After multiple failed attempts with Route 53 automation, decided to migrate to Namesilo DNS API.

**Reasons for Migration**:
1. **Simpler API**: Namesilo uses simple HTTP GET requests vs. Route 53's complex JSON
2. **No IAM Required**: API key-based authentication, no AWS IAM complexity
3. **Shell-Friendly**: Single curl command vs. multi-line bash scripts
4. **Proven Reliability**: Namesilo API known for stability

**Migration Process**:

1. **DNS Provider Switch**:
   - Transferred domain management from Route 53 to Namesilo
   - Updated nameservers at domain registrar
   - Waited for DNS propagation (24-48 hours)

2. **API Integration**:
   - Obtained Namesilo API key
   - Identified DNS record ID: `<record-id>`
   - Created simplified update script:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/sh
     # Get container IP
     TASK_METADATA=$(curl -s $ECS_CONTAINER_METADATA_URI_V4/task)
     PUBLIC_IP=$(echo $TASK_METADATA | jq -r '.Containers[0].Networks[0].IPv4Addresses[0]')
     
     # Update Namesilo DNS
     curl "https://www.namesilo.com/api/dnsUpdateRecord?version=1&type=xml&key=${NAMESILO_API_KEY}&domain=jcarl.net&rrid=<record-id>&rrhost=project&rrvalue=${PUBLIC_IP}&rrttl=7207"
     ```

3. **Dockerfile Updates**:
   - Removed AWS CLI installation (no longer needed)
   - Kept curl and jq (lightweight dependencies)
   - Simplified startup script
   - Reduced container image size

4. **ECS Task Definition Updates**:
   - Added `NAMESILO_API_KEY` environment variable
   - Removed Route 53 IAM role references
   - Simplified task role permissions

**Results**:
- **Task Revision 7**: Successfully deployed and stable
- **DNS Updates**: Working reliably on container startup
- **Health Checks**: Passing consistently
- **No Rollbacks**: Circuit breaker no longer triggering

**Learning**: Sometimes the best solution is the simplest one. Third-party APIs can be more reliable than complex AWS service integrations.

---

### Challenge 6: DNS TTL and Propagation Delays

**Problem**: DNS changes taking too long to propagate globally.

**Initial TTL**: 300 seconds (5 minutes) - inherited from Route 53

**Issue**: When ECS tasks restarted with new IPs, users experienced downtime during DNS propagation.

**Solution**: Increased TTL to 7207 seconds (~2 hours)
- **Rationale**: ECS tasks restart infrequently in production
- **Benefit**: Reduced DNS query load on Namesilo
- **Trade-off**: Longer propagation time when IP changes (acceptable for this use case)

**Learning**: TTL values should match deployment patterns. Frequent changes need low TTL; stable deployments can use higher TTL for better caching.
